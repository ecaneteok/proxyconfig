# proxyconfig
This is a script for proxy configuration.

Tired of errors and settting up manually all the apps that needed proxy configuration I wroted a powershell script to set this up for me.

This setup the following apps: 
-Windows Internet Congiguration 
-NPM 
-NuGet 
-GIT 
-Environment Variables

Enjoy :)
